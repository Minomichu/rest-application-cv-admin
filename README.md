# Admin CV

A CV that the user can edit.  
Created with php, MySQL, Fetch API and JavaScript.  
Supports CRUD and almost everything on the page is editable. 
The whole page has been built with JavaScript input fields letting the user stay on the same spot when editing or adding instead of being directed to a pop-up form.  
Please observe (because I’m kind of impressed with myself there) how when you click to update or add something all the other buttons goes hidden, preventing the user from starting on something new before saving the former.

Uses the same CSS-file as the frontend page but in retrospect it wasn’t the best idea sharing one CSS-file with two different folders.  
I also should have reset the input fields since they differ a tiny bit depending on browser.

Admin user: myUsername  
Admin password: myPassword

Please observe that anyone can login and edit so don’t trust the text or images :)
